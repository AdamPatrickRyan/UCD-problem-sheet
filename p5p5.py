#Write a program that takes as input a string and checks whether the string entered is the name of a town
#or city known to the program. The towns and cities should include: Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Limerick, Derry,
#Galway, Lisburn, Kilkenny, Waterford and Sligo. If the name of one of these towns or cities is entered, the
#program should print out the string “You entered x. x is in y.”, where x is the name of the town or city and
#y is the province (Ulster, Munster, Leinster or Connacht) in which the town or city is situated. If the string
#entered is not recognised, the message “Sorry, I didn’t recognise that name.” should be printed out.
